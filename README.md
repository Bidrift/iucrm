## Project Description

Our project is a web application developed as part of the Advanced Engineering Program at Innopolis University. It serves as a Demo Panel for showcasing AI products implemented by our university, including an AI chatbot, AI image generator, Coder Parses, and more. The main goal of our product is to let users (businessmen, politicians, technical partners) test and interact with the developed tools through a user-friendly interface, in a convenient and fast way, for big events, meetings, and conferences.
